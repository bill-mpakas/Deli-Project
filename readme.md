## What is this?

Learning to build from Web Ninja Wes Bos and his awesome course a full stack restaurant application which users can search, geolocate, review and curate their favourite restaurants from around the world.

I took this course in order to gain a back-end knowledge of the most modern web technologies including

*User Accounts
*REST API endpoints
*Database Schemas
*Document Relationships
*Templating and Mixins
*Restricting Operations
*Middleware
*Image Resizing
*Password Reset Flow
*Storing Geospatial Data
*Routing
*Flow Control
*Error Handling
*Advanced DB Queries
*File Uploading
*Sending Email
*MVC Pattern
*Geocoding Addresses
*Pagination
*Server Deployment

The application has three main models — Users, Stores and Reviews — all of which are relational. It is designed to hit upon many of today's application needs such as user authentication, database storage, Ajax REST API, file upload and image resizing.


## Future of this Project

As an entry front-end developer i am planning to edit the UI of the application using modern techniques
